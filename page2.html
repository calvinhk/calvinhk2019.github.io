<h2>The Importance of the Arts</h2>
	<p style="text-align:justify">
		The public appreciation toward the humanities has declined significantly over the years as day to day work schedules and lesser forms media have overtaken the public eye. Political topics shifted away from a finer appreciation of the arts when it is just as important to the everyday person. The general public’s awareness toward the arts must be made known or the United States will continue to decline in comparison to the rest of the world in placing value toward public art projects. The people of the United States must be made aware of just how important the public arts are and why the government should place a larger emphasis on its role within society. The value of public art is immeasurable in terms of influence though there are <a href="https://www.arts.gov/publications/international-data-government-spending-arts">Studies</a> that can help define an idea of how it improves the general public. Public works and restoration fall in line with public arts spending and governments at the local and state level who have taken initiative to beautifying their cities have created safer and cleaner locations. In the previous link, it is made clear that governments who spend more toward the humanities and promotion of a public space dedicated toward art diversify lifestyles and inspire citizens. It also creates a higher economic value in the area as tourists and other business draw from the general attractions. An example of a district dedicated to art within the city is the <a href="https://www.tripsavvy.com/the-complete-guide-to-wynwood-miami-4174451"</a></p>

<h2>Art Districts and their Benefits</h2>
	<p style="text-align:justify">	The Wynwood district was generally considered a low income area before it became the largest open area art muesum with large murals and attractions. It has since been a crucial tourist location. Thus, providing income and joy to the citizens and city in a mutual symbiotic relationship. A model toward restoring real estate and creating art around the area for economic and quality of life improvements can be viewed in many cities across the United States. Neighborhoods such as Brooklyn, downtown Washington D.C., the L.A. Arts District have proven that time and time again, success is met with a turn toward emphasizing the humanities. While the Federal Government is more responsible toward National Museums and conservation of National Monuments, it still plays a critical role in how much funding may be granted with the direct public spending on the arts.
	</p>
<h2>The Current Situation</h2>
	<p style="text-align:justify">	The National Endowment for the Arts (see link above) stated in a two decade old report that “...the United States spends about $6 per person on direct public spending on arts, the lowest of any of the countries tracked by the ACE study.” Their budget for 2000, according to their data was roughly $ 97,627,600 whereas their budget last year has only gone up to $155,000,000. Steadily increasing throughout the years... That same research from 2000 stated that Germany spent about $86 per person on direct public spending on arts. Over the course of 20 years, one would hope that the United States has decided to improve their standing in relation to other developed countries, but this number has changed very little.
