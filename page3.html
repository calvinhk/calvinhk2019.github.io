<h2>What is a Modern Novel?</h2>
	<p style="text-align:justify">
There are many definitions that come to mind when someone presents the word modern. Most people think contemporary whereas some may consider the modern period of the 20th century, however modern can also take on a deeper meaning. The Oxford dictionary defines an aspect of modern as a significant departure from “traditional styles and values.” This is an important thing to consider when combining it with what the “modern novel” is, as a novel is a longer work of written fiction that is usually broken up into many chapters. If both of these definitions were taken, along with the widespread definition of modern, that means the modern novel is a term used to define novels of the more recent times which ultimately give new insights and direction toward topics that still hold an impact to today’s time. That former phrase meaning, still relating to living generations. These novels also break away from the traditional novel format to provide these new insights, which will be essential in understanding the modern novel and works under this category should be read.	The modern novel is a genre that can be further defined by the larger genres as it extends to magical realism, mystery, and more. If the framework above is used to further classify these genres, only a handful of books can be truly defined as the modern novel as the breakaway from the traditional format is unique to the book. A book that can be looked at for its time is Chuck Palahniuk’s Invisible Monsters, the book that was written before Fight Club, but came out after it. This was mainly because of the content of the story and the layout in which the events were presented. It was done so in an out-of-chronological order to present the first person events in a manner that was fresh and new. This, sided with the fact that many of the characters identified themselves with different names, also presented what the publisher’s deemed to be too crazy and that no one would like it. Little did they know Palahniuk would write Fight Club as a response which ultimately got his first book published. The reason for this small story behind the publication is how a book such as Invisible Monsters embodies the modern novel and stands out among the rest.
The story is able to engage with the reader as it carefully navigates controversial issues such as the modeling industry, mental illness, media and expectation, as well as queerness and transgenderism in this new style. It broke away from the traditional to convey these insights about these topics which still relate today and were very much difficult for the time it was written in: 1990’s. This book was a breakthrough for the time period and is still relevant to today, which brings back the more important question of “why read the modern novel?”

<h2>Why Should We Focus on Books like this?</h2>
<p> The Modern Novel brings up commentaries that can enrich the knowledge of the reader. Even though it is a work of fiction, the themes and topics that emerge from it are very much real. It is a chance to bring fiction back into relevance and still make reading recreational as many people, despite switching to audiobooks, have been consuming less and less literature over the years. 2017 was the lowest it has ever been for recreational reading among the American people. This is a striking concern that can be combated with shifting the focus of genre. It is important to understand, that in reading the modern novel, readers are able to move away from the novels that repeat the same story or format, while also engaging in the present rather than in the history of the past. This is an alternative that could potentially encourage and revive reading within the people who crave something new or want to stress other things. Can you be a part of the new generation of readers?
