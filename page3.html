<h2>What is a Modern Novel?</h2>
	<p style="text-align:justify">
There are many definitions that come to mind when someone presents the word modern. Most people think contemporary whereas some may consider the modern period of the 20th century, however modern can also take on a deeper meaning. The Oxford dictionary defines an aspect of modern as a significant departure from “traditional styles and values.” This is an important thing to consider when combining it with what the “modern novel” is, as a novel is a longer work of written fiction that is usually broken up into many chapters. If both of these definitions were taken, along with the widespread definition of modern, that means the modern novel is a term used to define novels of the more recent times which ultimately give new insights and direction toward topics that still hold an impact to today’s time. That former phrase meaning, still relating to living generations. These novels also break away from the traditional novel format to provide these new insights, which will be essential in understanding the modern novel and works under this category should be read.
